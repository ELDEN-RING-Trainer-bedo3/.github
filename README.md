## 🧠 What’s a Trainer in ELDEN RING?

A **trainer** is a powerful tool that lets you inject cheat functions directly into your game in real time. No modding, no save file corruption — just pure domination at the tap of a hotkey. It’s perfect for exploring builds, breaking the game, or just having fun.

Whether you’re on NG+7 or fresh outta the cave, the trainer makes every run legendary.
